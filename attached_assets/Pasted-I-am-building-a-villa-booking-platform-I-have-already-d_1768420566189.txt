I am building a villa booking platform.

I have already developed a "Villa Availability Calendar" component. Now I want the following system implemented:

Goal:
Each villa owner should have their own availability calendar webpage where they can update daily booking status. When the owner updates availability, it should immediately reflect:
1) on that villa’s calendar on the main website
2) inside the admin panel under that property’s details card

System requirements:
- Create database models for Villas and Availability
- Each villa should have unique ID and owner ID
- Availability should support:
  - today’s status (Available / Booked / Partially Available)
  - ability to block specific future dates
  - real-time updates

Owner side:
- Create login system for villa owners
- Each owner can only access their own villa calendar
- Provide UI with:
  - calendar view
  - toggle buttons to mark dates as booked or available
- When owner updates availability:
  - changes are saved to DB
  - instantly reflected on main website property calendar

Public website side:
- Property page should show live availability calendar using same database
- No caching delay — real-time display

Admin panel:
- Admin can view and edit availability for any villa
- In property list, each property card should contain:
  - button “View Availability Calendar”
- Admin can override owner’s updates if necessary

Technical:
- Use my existing tech stack:
  - React / TypeScript / Vite frontend
  - Node.js backend
  - PostgreSQL database
- Create secure APIs:
  - GET availability by villaId
  - POST/PUT update availability by owner
  - Admin routes should be separate and protected

Additional:
- Add timestamps for last updated date
- If owner has not updated availability for 48 hours, mark status as “Needs Update”

Deliverables:
- database schema
- backend API routes
- frontend pages:
  1) Owner calendar page
  2) Public villa calendar display
  3) Admin calendar management
- Connect all parts together end-to-end
